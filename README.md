# Electricity Theft Detection and Illegal Connections

# Overview

Electricity theft in South Africa is a growing issue that causes significant financial losses, grid instability, and worsens the national power crisis. The country loses approximately R6 billion annually due to illegal connections, meter tampering, and unpaid bills. These practices, especially prevalent in low-income communities, are often driven by energy poverty and the unaffordability of electricity. However, they pose serious risks such as electrical fires and injuries, and also exacerbate power outages, grid overloads, and operational costs for Eskom, South Africaâ€™s main electricity provider.

Globally, electricity theft undermines grid stability and the ability of utility companies to provide reliable services. In some developing nations, up to 30% of generated electricity is lost to theft. Conventional detection methods like manual inspections or consumption anomaly analysis are inefficient, prone to errors, and unable to scale with growing grids. These traditional methods also struggle to detect sophisticated theft patterns, which continue to evolve, making it difficult for utilities to accurately measure usage and bill customers. As a result, electricity theft remains a critical challenge that disrupts daily life and contributes to the ongoing energy crisis.

# Objective (Proposed Solution)

The objective of this project is to develop an automated, scalable, and accurate solution using machine learning techniques to detect electricity theft and illegal connections in real-time or near-real-time. By leveraging historical consumption data, meter readings, and customer profiles, machine learning models can identify abnormal consumption patterns and potential theft scenarios with greater accuracy and efficiency.

# Features of the Proposed Solution

1.  **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying irregular electricity consumption patterns that deviate from expected norms.
2. **Classification of Theft Types**: Distinguishing between different forms of electricity theft, such as meter tampering, illegal tapping, and bypassing.
3.  **Real-time Monitoring**: Enabling utility companies to deploy smart meters and IoT devices that work in tandem with machine learning algorithms for continuous monitoring of electricity usage.
4. **Reduction of False Positives**: Minimizing erroneous alerts by using advanced techniques to better differentiate between genuine consumption spikes and fraudulent activity.

# Challenges

1. **Data Quality and Availability**: Ensuring access to clean, well-labeled, and diverse data from multiple sources (smart meters, utility databases, customer usage profiles) for effective model training.
2. **Scalability**: The solution should be capable of processing massive datasets from millions of customers in real-time.
3. **Evolving Theft Techniques**: The system needs to continuously learn and adapt to emerging theft methods and changing consumer behaviors.
4. **Cost-efficiency**: The deployment and maintenance of machine learning-based theft detection systems should be cost-effective to ensure widespread adoption by utility companies.

# Data Description
The dataset contains information on electricity consumption, timestamps, and customer data. It includes both normal and abnormal (potential theft) consumption patterns.

## Key Columns:

**timestamp**: Date and time of the meter reading.
**consumption**: The amount of electricity consumed during a given period.
**customer_id**: Identifier for each customer.
**theft**: Target variable indicating whether a case is identified as theft (1) or not (0).
